A software engineer who loves early stage start-up, strongly believes in technologies. Experienced at writing code in a high-paced environment.

Presently, I am working as a Data Engineer at [Momenti](https://momenti.tv) where I am helping to build a new media platform while gain insights from tremendous interaction data.

Also I've helped early stage start-ups like [Baroga](https://www.바로가.com), [Meliora Partners](https://meliorapartners.com) as a technical consultant.
