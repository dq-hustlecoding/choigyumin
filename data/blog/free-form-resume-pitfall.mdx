Hello, this is Hustle Coding Academy.

Let's start today

with the topic of the free-form resume pitfall.

First of all, there are people who are mistaken

when you say that it is freestyle.

Freeform does not mean that there is no form

Freestyle doesn't mean

you have to destroy form

and create some creative form.

Freestyle means that the company does not provide a format

is just a meaning, and you have to match

the convention on your resume.

Let's take a look at the convention

in that resume today.

The order of writing

a resume is divided into this broadly,

but the first is personal information.

Write your name and contact information to you
Can you send me a notification of acceptance?

And it's a core competency.

In the case of this core competency, there is an optional part.

It doesn't really matter whether you use it or not.

But if there is something I really want to emphasize

in this part,

mentioning the core competency separately

can be a point that can be differentiated a bit.

And experience. Experience is the most important thing.

You must write in reverse chronological order.

chronological order

This means that the most recent experience should be

at the top.

And it's a good idea to sub-category

three to five

technical achievements

between careers.

Technological achievements

are the results

of any of these technical achievements

on any project in your career.

You can write these as sub-items.

The reason why

I wrote three or five here

means that I worked at a company

for a long time

and at another company

for a short time.

And then, I have to write down my academic background,

project experience, and other things like that.

In fact, you can think of the order in your resume

as having the most important

and most bragging parts

at the top.

In a sense, your academic background can come first.

Ah, I really have a great

academic background.

And if you have a lot of project experience

and say you have great experience,

you can write your project experience at the top.

I also had a few questions about the portfolio.

Basically, it's good to attach a portfolio as a separate link.

Most of the time, a blog, notion

page, or Github link is given as a link.

Of course, it would be nice to give a portfolio link.

However, the part that you should not be mistaken is that

just because you have attached a link to the portfolio,

the interviewer does not read all the contents of the person

who reviews all the contents.

For example, if a blog has 50 posts,

few people will be able to read all 50 of them.

Therefore, in the case of a portfolio,

it is good to refer to the second article,

but it is good to refer to the subcategory of work

experience or project experience.
Adding

a portfolio link is a plus.

What does this mean?

You wrote 50 posts on your blog, for example.

But if a specific article says that

I wrote an article about state management

in a certain React from project experience,

for example,

I put a portfolio link in the sub-item of the project.

I have summarized these technical achievements

in this blog.

If you make an argument with a link like this,

there is no reason for the interviewer not to see it.

Then you will get a very positive score.

And should I write this in my portfolio again or not?

I get this question a lot,

but there is nothing I should not write in my portfolio.

You can write them all down

However, the part you need to worry about now

is that when I write this in the portfolio,

all these small details can be reflected

in the evaluation.

So this will be reflected in the evaluation

If you think so, you better write it down.

I would also like to say that

the maximum number of resumes is 3 pages.

Even if you have a lot of experience, in fact,

if there are more than three pages,

it will be very tiring for the reviewer.

Therefore, please do not exceed a maximum of 3 resumes.

Engineers with more than 20 years of experience

are highly likely to lose their experience

20 years ago.

It's likely outdated technology.

That's why it's

better to write down your career

based on your core career, and write it down

so that the interviewer

can give the impression

that you're really great

and that you're the person I really want to hire.
