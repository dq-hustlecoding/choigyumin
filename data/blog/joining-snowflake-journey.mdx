After several years of building data infrastructure at startups across Singapore, New York, and Seoul, I recently made a significant career move: joining Snowflake as a Solution Engineer.

Here is why.

## The Decision

When I was considering my next move, I had several options:
- Continue on the IC (Individual Contributor) path as a senior/staff engineer
- Move into engineering management
- Transition to a customer-facing technical role

Each had its appeal, but the Solution Engineer role at Snowflake checked boxes I did not even know I had.

## Why Solution Engineering?

### 1. Breadth of Problems

As a data engineer at a single company, you solve that company's problems. As a Solution Engineer, you see hundreds of different architectures, challenges, and use cases.

In my first few months, I have worked with:
- A major retailer optimizing their supply chain analytics
- A fintech building real-time fraud detection
- A healthcare company implementing data governance for compliance

Each engagement teaches me something new about how organizations use data.

### 2. Impact at Scale

At a startup, I might impact thousands of users. At Snowflake, the solutions I help design impact millions.

When you help an enterprise modernize their data platform, the ripple effects touch:
- Every analyst running queries
- Every dashboard refreshing
- Every ML model training
- Every business decision informed by data

### 3. The Perfect Middle Ground

Solution Engineering sits at the intersection of:
- **Technical depth**: You need to understand architecture, performance, security
- **Business acumen**: You need to understand what problems actually matter
- **Communication**: You need to explain complex concepts to diverse audiences

This matches how I like to work. Pure coding can feel disconnected from impact. Pure sales can feel disconnected from reality. SE work combines the best of both.

## Why Snowflake?

### The Product

I have been using and recommending Snowflake since 2022. The product genuinely solves real problems:

- **Separation of storage and compute**: Game-changer for cost optimization
- **Zero-copy cloning**: Makes development and testing so much easier
- **Data sharing**: The killer feature most people underutilize
- **Snowpark**: Python and other languages native in the warehouse

I am not just selling something I believe in - I am helping people use something that actually works.

### The Market Position

Snowflake is at an interesting inflection point:
- Established enough to have enterprise credibility
- Growing fast enough that there is still room to make impact
- Investing heavily in AI/ML capabilities (Cortex, etc.)

The data platform market is consolidating, and Snowflake is well-positioned for the future.

### The Team

Every person I met during the interview process was sharp, curious, and genuinely helpful. The culture feels collaborative rather than competitive.

## What I Do Day-to-Day

A typical week might include:

**Monday-Tuesday: Customer Engagements**
- Technical deep-dives with engineering teams
- Architecture reviews and recommendations
- Proof-of-concept support

**Wednesday: Internal Work**
- Building demo environments
- Creating technical content
- Learning new features

**Thursday-Friday: Mix**
- Follow-ups with customers
- Team syncs and knowledge sharing
- Preparation for next week's engagements

No two weeks are the same, which keeps things interesting.

## Lessons from the Transition

### Technical Skills Transfer

Everything I learned as a data engineer is directly applicable:
- Understanding of data modeling
- Experience with ETL/ELT patterns
- Knowledge of performance optimization
- Familiarity with cloud platforms

The difference is now I apply these skills across many customers instead of one.

### New Skills to Develop

Areas I am actively working on:
- **Presentation skills**: Explaining complex topics to executives
- **Discovery skills**: Understanding customer needs through questions
- **Industry knowledge**: Learning verticals I had not worked in before

### The Mindset Shift

As an engineer, success is shipping features and maintaining systems. As an SE, success is helping customers succeed.

This sounds subtle but changes how you think:
- Less "here is how our product works"
- More "here is how our product solves your problem"

## Advice for Engineers Considering SE Roles

If you are thinking about a similar transition:

**Good signs it might be for you:**
- You enjoy explaining technical concepts
- You are curious about different industries and use cases
- You want more variety in your work
- You are comfortable with ambiguity

**Things to consider:**
- You will write less code (but not zero code)
- Your schedule is less predictable
- Success metrics are different (customer outcomes vs. PRs merged)
- Travel may be required (varies by role/region)

**How to prepare:**
- Practice explaining technical concepts to non-technical people
- Learn about the business side of technology decisions
- Understand how companies evaluate and purchase software
- Build expertise in a domain (data platforms, in my case)

## Looking Forward

I am excited about what is ahead:
- Helping enterprises modernize their data infrastructure
- Learning from hundreds of different architectures
- Contributing to Snowflake's product direction through customer feedback
- Building relationships across the Korean and APAC tech ecosystem
