From late 2020 to early 2022, I served as the CTO of an early-stage startup in Singapore. It was one of the most challenging and rewarding experiences of my career. Here is what I learned.

## The Context

The startup was building a content recommendation platform. When I joined, we had:
- 3 people (including me)
- A vague product vision
- 6 months of runway
- Zero technical infrastructure

By the time I left, we had:
- A working product with real users
- A recommendation engine with 85% accuracy
- A small but effective engineering team
- Extended runway through a seed round

## Technical Decisions That Mattered

### 1. Recommendation Engine Architecture

Building a recommendation engine from scratch was our core technical challenge. We went with a hybrid approach:

**Collaborative Filtering (LightGCN)**
- Graph-based neural network for user-item interactions
- Better than traditional matrix factorization for sparse data
- Required significant GPU resources for training

**Content-Based Fallback (ALS)**
- Solved the cold-start problem for new users
- Used item features when we lacked interaction data
- Much cheaper to run

The key insight: **you need both**. Pure collaborative filtering fails for new users, and pure content-based misses the serendipity that makes recommendations feel magical.

### 2. Backend Stack Choice

We chose NestJS with GraphQL. In retrospect, this was the right call:

**Why NestJS:**
- TypeScript-first with great DX
- Modular architecture scales well
- Excellent decorator-based patterns

**Why GraphQL:**
- Mobile clients could request exactly what they needed
- Single endpoint simplified client development
- Great tooling (Apollo, code generation)

### 3. Infrastructure Decisions

We went all-in on AWS with:
- ECS Fargate for containers
- RDS PostgreSQL for primary data
- ElastiCache Redis for sessions and caching
- S3 + CloudFront for media

**What I would change:** I would seriously consider serverless-first today. Our infrastructure costs were significant for a startup, and managing containers was overhead we did not need early on.

## Leadership Lessons

### Hiring is Everything (and Incredibly Hard)

As CTO, I spent ~40% of my time on hiring. Key lessons:

1. **Culture fit matters more than skills** - You can teach technology, not values
2. **Take-home assignments reveal more than interviews** - We learned more from a 4-hour project than 10 hours of interviews
3. **Reference checks are underrated** - Actually call references, ask specific questions

### Technical Debt is a Business Decision

Every shortcut has a cost. I learned to frame technical debt in business terms:

*"We can ship this feature in 2 weeks with technical debt, or 4 weeks without. The debt will cost us ~1 week per month in slowdown. When do we need this feature to hit our metrics?"*

This framing got much better buy-in from non-technical co-founders.

### Communication is Your Primary Job

As CTO, your job is not writing code. It is:

1. **Translating** business needs into technical requirements
2. **Communicating** technical constraints to business stakeholders
3. **Aligning** the engineering team around shared goals
4. **Unblocking** people who are stuck

I probably spent 60% of my time in meetings, 20% on architecture/code review, and 20% writing code myself.

## What I Would Do Differently

### 1. Hire a Senior Engineer Earlier

I tried to do too much myself. Bringing in a senior engineer 3 months earlier would have been worth the runway cost.

### 2. Set Up Better Processes from Day One

We operated in chaos mode for too long. Simple processes like:
- Weekly sprint planning
- Daily standups
- Code review requirements

These are not bureaucracy. They are communication infrastructure.

### 3. Take More Breaks

Startup life is intense. I burned out multiple times because I did not protect my recovery time. Sustainable pace matters more than heroic sprints.

## Was It Worth It?

Absolutely. Being a startup CTO taught me:

- How to make decisions with incomplete information
- How to build and lead a team
- How to balance technical idealism with business pragmatism
- What I actually value in work

Even though the startup did not become a unicorn, the experience was invaluable. If you are considering a similar role, I would encourage you to go for it - but go in with realistic expectations.

The best career growth often happens in the most uncomfortable situations.
