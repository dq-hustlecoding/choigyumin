Hello, this is Hustle Coding Academy that supports your hustle coding.

Today, I am going to talk about portfolio

on the topic of Github Guide.

In fact, we have experience

increasing the pass rate of developer documents

by more than 30 percent this way.

First of all, what is the best portfolio?

The extreme of your portfolio

is a well-organized tech blog.

What I mean is, what technical achievements

you get on a daily basis,
technical concerns.

If these parts are well organized,

it means that such a technical blog itself becomes a portfolio.

And a little bit

lower than that

is the Notion

Page

And at a lower level than that,

there must be a Readme file on Github.

Actually, organizing the readme file on github or organizing the code

Of course, this can also

play the role of a portfolio,

but from the interviewer's point of view,

it was a little difficult to say

that it had any impact on admission.

I will explain this

in a little more detail later.

A portfolio, no matter how well you write

it, is not as good as a good resume.

Basically, the portfolio is always reviewed

after the resume is reviewed.

So if your resume isn't attractive,

chances are you won't look at your portfolio.

So what's the surest way to get an interviewer

to review your portfolio?

That's what makes the link between your resume

and portfolio strong.

Now let me explain in detail.

career on resume

When writing sub-items in the project section,

the related portfolio links are also included.

That is, it is used like a kind of resume commentary.

For example, let's say you wrote a single line in your resume

called Global State Management with Redux.

Then, if there is a blog post

that summarizes the Redux state management,

"How did you manage this project",

I will write the link to the blog post at the bottom.

If you write it down like that,

there is no reason for the interviewer not to go in.

I do state management with Redux,

and I have organized it

in a blog about how it was

applied in this project,

so the contents are clear

and it is not burdensome to see.

It's hard to see everything

But, if someone who wants to hire an engineer

who is good at Redux

shows an article like this, I will definitely see it.

Also, I've seen a lot of cases

where GitHub management is too severe in relation to portfolios.

Of course, doing GitHub

management is better than not doing it.

But think of yourself as an interviewer, and take a look at

another developer's GitHub.

Then you can see that

it is very difficult to evaluate

So, a blog post is a well-organized

form of what you want to emphasize

on your resume.

Creating a portfolio in this way

can increase your chances of passing by

more than 30 percent.
