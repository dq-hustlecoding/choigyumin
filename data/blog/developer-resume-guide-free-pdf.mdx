Hello, this is Hustle

Coding Academy that supports your hustle coding.

Let's start today with the topic

The Complete Developer Resume Guide.

If you are a non-major documentary,

please see it as a must.

is the first

Never rewrite an existing resume

In particular, if you are a non-major,

we recommend that you write in a new template rather than rewriting your existing resume.

The reason for writing this is that if you are a non-major,

you can rewrite your existing resume and submit it as a developer

resume with slight modifications.

However, a developer resume is very different

from a traditional clerical resume.

Therefore, it is recommended to write a new template

in a new template

and a developer-only template.

First of all, it is diagnosis point 1.

Did you use a well-made template? You may ask, why is this template important?

Picking a good template

can be the starting point for a good resume

Therefore, please see the resumes

through the new developer

resume template in Google and write through the template.

These templates are also included

in the free PDF file

I want to distribute,

so it would be good to refer to how to write them.

This is the second diagnostic point.

If the size of your resume is less than two A4 papers

or two A4 papers, in fact,

even those with more

than 10 years of development experience

can melt your resume in it.

There are effective ways to reduce the amount of your resume

First, as I said earlier,

we find a good template and create a new resume in English.

A lot of development terms are in English,

so don't feel burdened with

writing your resume in English.

And the completed resume is translated into Korean through Google

Translate, Papago Translate, etc.

And you can complete the Korean resume by refining the translated resume

so that it is not awkward.

When you do this,

you'll actually see a lot of students

cut down on the volume effectively,

and reducing the size of your resume

leaves the skills

you want to brag about on your resume.

That's why it's so important to cut back on your resume.

Diagnostic point is the third

Isn't there a section

that only lists the technology?

This is what many of you are writing like this.

It is often a simple listing of the technology stack.

However, if you simply list the technology stack,

the interviewer will not be able to know

what kind of work you have done

and how much understanding you have about the technology stack.

Therefore, it is recommended to write

in detail

the development method in which project

and what kind of results were obtained.

If it's difficult to write this specifically,

it's better not to write such a tech stack.

Diagnosis point 4

Use specific numbers

to attract the

interviewer's interest

I asked you to write down

the results of your

technological development

Basically, the interviewers have

an understanding of the technical stack

and the projects they've been doing,

and that's the point

they are curious about

what kind of technology they know well.

this is the last

Diagnosis point Fifth, write the thing you are most proud of at the top.

The point of what I want to brag about here has to be technology.

Skills are the most important factor in hiring developers

That's why it's so important to put the skills

you want to show off the most at the top.

Among the resumes I've seen, I've seen

a lot of people who wrote the team leader

or project manager at the top.

These are important roles in the PM or PO job,

not as a developer.

It's not that it's not important,

but it means that the most important

thing should be described.

Therefore, keep in mind that the order is also important,

and we recommend that you write the skills

you want to boast the most at the top.

This is what I prepared today.

If you want to know more about what I have prepared,

I have written how to receive a pdf

file in the comments,

so I recommend that you come to the Kakao Channel

and apply for a pdf to receive a free 34-page pdf

in more detail. I'll give you

Then, up to this point, I have included the Hustle Coding Academy to support your hustle coding.
