Hello, this is Hustle Coding Academy that supports your hustle coding.

Today, let's start

with the topic of where to go

for start-up conglomerates.

Let's start today by revealing that

this is the personal opinion of a developer

currently attending an American startup.

First of all, in today's discussion,

general large corporations such as manufacturing and telecommunication

businesses will be excluded from discussion.

So, what kind of large companies are there?

There are large IT companies, such as Neckarakubae, etc.

So this general large company will be discussed today.

To make one short comment, there are many changes these days,

but there is a possibility that the development culture is lacking.

I'll just comment like that and keep it short.

Now, startups vs.

IT giants, Neckarakubae, etc.

Basically, it can be seen that the preparation stage is different.

The talent you want is different.

So, in the case of start-ups,

all-rounders and generalists

are the human resources that are sought,

and in the case of large companies,

they tend to want specialists and experts in one field.

Therefore, even in the preparation stage,

there is an aspect that startups

place more importance on practical skills

such as toy projects.

In the case of large companies,

if you prepare for a coding test,

there are some parts that are covered.

For example, if you are preparing

for a coding

test in general,

other big companies other than Neckarakuba

all take the coding test in common.

I can see it's open

On the other hand, in the case of start-ups,

especially those in the early stage,

toy projects

There is a part

that places more importance on practical coding skills

Because the verification process of seeing

the coding test

takes a lot of manpower and time.

So, when choosing a career path,

you need to know how to make a choice and ultimately know your disposition.

I'll make my own service later

If I say I want to start a business,

it would be better to play an active part as an all-rounder in a startup.

So, while working as an all-rounder

in a startup,

I should learn how to grow my startup

and what kind of business

part is important.

There must be a tendency

to be able to think like this.

And as an office worker,

the environment where you can comfortably walk around

like a public official

can now be said to be the environment of a large corporation.

Therefore, just because it is a large company,

it cannot be said that it is comfortable,

and just because it is a startup,

it cannot be said that it is bad.

Please be aware that we are always Timba Team Bubbaboo.

And from startups to large companies

from large companies to startups A few years ago, in fact,

it was not so common to go from a startup to a large company

or from a large company to a startup like this.

But last year and this year,

I see a lot of people moving from startups

to large companies

or from large companies to startups.

Now, in your case,

if you change jobs,

the reason is very important.

Why are you moving? For some reason,

I am moving.

For example, I used to work for a large company,

but now I finally have to start my own business.

It would be a very good motivator

if you change jobs

just because you said that

you want to start a business

and want to know how the ecology of a startup works

by joining a startup as an exercise.

However, it can be said

that it is a bit risky to change jobs

simply because the salary is better

or the treatment is good.

In particular, the two types of companies differ in many ways.

The actual working environment may be different, and

as I said earlier,

such a specialized work environment

in a large corporation

and such a general work

environment in a startup are slightly different,

so you may havetily changed jobs and regret your choice.

Also, the reward system is different.

If you do not have a sufficient

understanding of compensation systems

such as stock options,

RSU, and ESOP, it can be a choice you will regret when making a choice.

Therefore, rather than moving hastily,

we recommend that you thoroughly research

and prepare for the change.

It was the Hustle Coding Academy

that supports the hustle coding of all developers until now. Thank you
